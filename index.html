        <h2>Dear Jozelle,</h2>
        <p>
            It's been like a month since I laid eyes on you, and while time is still passing, I've developed my feelings for you. A pure one, but I admit that at first, it was just an attraction to your beauty. But as time goes on, I find myself always thinking about the times when we talked, the times where I found myself looking at you every second of our interaction and I still can't stop thinking about it.
        </p>
        <p>
            My friends call me stupid because I know you already sent me a bunch of signs to leave you be or that you don't want me, but I can't let this school year end without being clear to myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            I like you, Jozelle, and I'm sure you probably know that. But what you don't know is that what I'm feeling isn't just infatuation. What I'm feeling is genuine. When I say "I like you," I mean that you're always on my mind, and I just can't stop thinking about you. I know a month is not a long time, but for me, time moved differently once I started to notice you.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've never stopped caring about you even if we haven't talked nor interacted for a pretty long time. Even right now, while I'm writing this message for you knowing that you'll probably ignore it I'm still thinking about the possible scenarios that will happen once I send this message to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Till now, I'm still regretting not apologizing because I made you uncomfortable. So I apologize for all of the times where I made you uncomfortable not just at the gala event but in our every meeting and interaction.
        </p>
        <p>
            I already know that you aren't interested in me, so it's okay. But if you feel like talking to me, then be my guest. But if you're not, then it's okay if you don't respond, or you can even just block me or something... Thank you for interacting with me even if you weren't comfy, and I appreciate every word you said to me. And, umm, thank you for being a small part of my life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yun lang, good luck sa buhay-buhay, Elle. Take care!!!
