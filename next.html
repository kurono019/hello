    Alright then, these past few days I'm still in shock of what happened. I realized I should've opened up to you when I had the chance. I really regret wasting the chance you had given me. Pretty short isn't it haha, well I hope it's the right timing to send this stuff to you. While writing this right now, I'm literally just sitting on a curb, listening to music while staring at the sky. In short, nakatulala lang talaga ako habang iniisip kung ano pang pwedeng sabihin dito. Pretty peaceful outside when it's dark and cold, you can see a lot of stars just shimmering their light which is really nice and relaxing. Sorry for such a random message, I really hope you're in the best form of yourself, but like if you pressed the no button then you're probably not fine so if you ever start to wonder — charot — I meant if you ever find yourself in a tough situation, breathe and just do what you do best, though I don't really know what you do best. Well this is it, I hope this message reaches you when you least expect it.
